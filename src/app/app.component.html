      This Angular project demonstrates a use case that cannot be implemented
      with the official i18n module.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ngx-formly is used to generate forms. With it, we can declare the form
      config within the component and the html is generated on-the-fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's why we need access to the translations within the component. Since
      Angular's i18n doesn't offer that possibility, ngx-translate is used.
